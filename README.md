AvaTaxLocal-Documentation
=========================
AvaTaxLocal is the Avalara sales tax solution for Point-Of-Sale applications. AvaTaxLocal is an on-site installation of the same tax engine used in our hosted service only with a local subset of the AvaTax data. It provides the same high level of accuracy without the dependency on an always-connected Internet link.
